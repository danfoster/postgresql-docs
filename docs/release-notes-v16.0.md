We are pleased to announce the launch of Percona Distribution for PostgreSQL 16.0 - a solution with the collection of tools from PostgreSQL community that are tested to work together and serve to assist you in deploying and managing PostgreSQL. The aim of Percona Distribution for PostgreSQL is to address the operational issues like High-Availability, Disaster Recovery, Security, Observability, Spatial data handling, Performance and Scalability and others that enterprises are facing.

This release of Percona Distribution for PostgreSQL is based on [PostgreSQL 16 :octicons-link-external-16:](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/16/release-16.html). 

## Release Highlights

Percona Distribution for PostgreSQL 16 features a lot of new functionalities and enhancements to performance, replication, monitoring, developer experience and more. Among them are the following:

* Performance improvements:

    * The support for CPU acceleration using SIMD (Single Instruction/Multiple Data) computing method for both x86 and ARM architectures 
    * Optimized processing of ASCII and JSON strings and array and subtransaction searches improve query processing performance.
    * The support of concurrent bulk data loading using `COPY` boost performance up to 300%.
    * Load balancing for `libpq` client simplifies scaling read queries.
    * The use of lz4 and zstd compression methods for `pg_dump` results in better compression performance compared to the default gzip compression method.

* Logical replication improvements include the ability to apply large transactions in parallel and the ability to perform logical decoding on standbys. This enables users to distribute their workloads among nodes. 
* Developer experience:

    * The standard for manipulating JSON data now includes the SQL/JSON constructors and the `ANY_VALUE` aggregate function, which returns any arbitrary value from the aggregate set. 
    * Developers can now specify non-decimal integers such as 0xff and 0o777.
    * Added support for the extended query protocol to the  `psql` client.


* Privilege administration improvements:

    * Logical replication subscribers now execute transactions on a table as the table owner, not the superuser.
    * Now only the users that have the ADMIN OPTION for roles can grant privileges in these roles using the `CREATEROLE` function. This allows fine-tuning privileges definition.
    * New predefined role `pg_maintain` enables non-superusers to run VACUUM, ANALYZE, CLUSTER, REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW, REINDEX, and LOCK TABLE on all tables.

* Database administrators can now view insights on I/O statistics in a separate `pg_stat_io` view provides.
