## Install an extension

To use an extension, install it. Run the [`CREATE EXTENSION`](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/sql-createextension.html) command on the PostgreSQL node where you want the extension to be available. 

The user should be a superuser or have the `CREATE` privilege on the current database to be able to run the [`CREATE EXTENSION`](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/sql-createextension.html) command. Some extensions may require additional privileges depending on their functionality. To learn more, check the documentation for the desired extension.
